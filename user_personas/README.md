# User Personas Directory

This directory contains the user personas developed for the CSC325 Class Project. User personas are fictional characters created to represent different user types that might use a service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. They help in understanding the users' needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals.

## Steps to Develop User Personas

### 1. Conduct User Research

- **Surveys**: Distribute surveys to a larger audience to gather quantitative data.
- **Analytics**: Use website analytics and user behavior tracking tools to gather data on how users interact with your product.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Study similar products and understand their user base.

### 2. Segment Your Users
- **Identify Patterns**: Look for patterns in the data collected from your research.
